# Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning Python from scratch.

My goal is to build a strong and deep foundation in programming, 
with a long-term focus on cybersecurity and Blue Team operations.

I prefer learning slowly but correctly, writing everything myself, 
and understanding the logic behind every concept.
